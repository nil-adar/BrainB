## Overview

BrainBridge is a web-based platform that integrates diagnostic assessment with evidence-based intervention strategies for students with ADHD. The system implements an 11-stage recommendation pipeline that generates personalized support plans across three domains: environmental adjustments, nutritional interventions, and physical activity.

**Key capabilities:**
- Multi-role workflows for teachers, parents, and students
- Integration with external diagnostic platform (NODUS)
- Real-time collaboration tools and progress tracking
- Bilingual interface (Hebrew/English) with full RTL support

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Frontend** – React + TypeScript interface with role-based access control
2. **Backend** – Node.js/Express API implementing the recommendation pipeline
3. **NODUS** – External Python/Django diagnostic engine with deep learning model

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- External: Python 3.10, Django, TensorFlow

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 16.x
- Python 3.10+ (for NODUS only)
- MongoDB (local or hosted)

### Setup

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nil-adar/BrainB.git
cd BrainB```
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
npm i
```

### Step 3: Configure environment
Create .env file:
```bash
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_connection_string
NODUS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

#### Terminal 4 – Run services
Open three terminals:
Terminal 1 – Frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Terminal 2 – Backend (Node.js)
```bash
npm run server
```

#### Terminal 3 – NODUS (Django) 
Required only if you want to run the external diagnostic engine that creates an External Assessment to unlock recommendations.
```bash
cd Nodus
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver 8000
```

💡 Ensure ts-node is available for backend dev:
```bash
npm install -g ts-node typescript
```
