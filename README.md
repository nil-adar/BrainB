## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone 
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd BrainB
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies
```bash
npm i
```

### Step 4: Run the development servers
Open **two terminals**:

#### Terminal 1 â€“ Frontend (Vite)
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Terminal 2 â€“ Backend (Node.js)
```bash
npm run server
```

This setup allows you to:
- View the frontend at `http://localhost:8080`
- Have the backend API listening on your defined port (e.g., `5000`)

---

ðŸ’¡ Make sure you have `ts-node` installed and configured properly for the backend to work. If needed, install it globally:
```bash
npm install -g ts-node typescript
```
